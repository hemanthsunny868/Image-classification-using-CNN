# Image-classification-using-CNN

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images into multiple categories. The goal is to preprocess image data, train a CNN model, evaluate its performance, and deploy a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

## Overview

Image classification is a core task in computer vision, enabling machines to understand and label images. This project focuses on:
- Building a CNN model from scratch.
- Using data augmentation to improve generalization.
- Evaluating model performance with test data.
- Creating a web app for real-time image classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from:
- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html): A dataset with 60,000 images across 10 categories.
- [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
- You can also use your custom dataset, ensuring it is organized into `train`, `validation`, and `test` folders.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resize images to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
   - Normalize pixel values and apply data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming).

2. **CNN Model Development**:
   - Build a CNN model with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
   - Use activation functions like ReLU and softmax.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train the model using the training dataset and validate its performance.
   - Evaluate on a separate test set and calculate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).

4. **Visualization**:
   - Plot training/validation loss and accuracy.
   - Visualize feature maps and activation layers.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Build a web interface using Streamlit or Flask for image upload and classification.
